# World Fairness Forum
This project shall emerge to be a fully decentralized forum supporting the [CULT](https://cultdao.io).   

Some say we are about to fuck the WEF because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7GY1Xg6X20).

## The Plan
The power they took from the people will return to the people. 

CULT is the financial hub of a new, free society.  
RVLT is the council & support system.
