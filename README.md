# World Fairness Forum

Those who create value will be rewarded.   
Those who intentionally create pain will be punished.  
Those who do nothing are invited to enjoy the show.  

The World Fairness Forum might inspire people to explore and potentially improve and support architectures of freedom. [See also](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cultmagazine#architecture).   

As such the World Fairness Forum might serve as an embodiment of freedom inspiring further embodiments of freedom.    

Some say we are about to fuck the WEF because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7GY1Xg6X20).

## The Plan
The power they took from the people will return to the people. 

CULT is the financial hub of a new, free society.  
RVLT is the council & support system.
