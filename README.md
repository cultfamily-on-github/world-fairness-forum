## Contribute
This project shall emerge to be a fully decentralized forum. So we might start by saying everyone is invited to contribute.
### Start Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-spengler/world-fairness-forum.git
cd world-fairness-forum
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. 

### Build / Generate Build Files for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
